Please follow the instructions in myMainScript.m to view the results for the 3 cases, i.e. Quadratic, Huber and Log prior. The main processing happens inside denoise_image.m which calls get_optimal_x_quadratic.m or get_optimal_x_huber.m or get_optimal_x_log.m depending on your choice. These functions return the optimal intensity at a pixel by minimizing the cost function(negative log likelihood) by using either the quadratic, Huber or Log prior( as per their names). The function get_rrmse.m returns the RRMSE value between the denoised image and the noiseless image.
